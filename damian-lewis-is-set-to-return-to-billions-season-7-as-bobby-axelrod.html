The Emmy-winning performer will resume his part as Bobby “Axe” Axelrod in the show’s seventh season, which will broadcast later this year.&nbsp;Lewis will appear in the forthcoming season, which is presently in production in New York, alongside Paul Giamatti, Corey Stoll, and Maggie Siff. The photographers broke the news of the actor’s comeback before the network formally verified it.</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>Just when you thought he was out… <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/NIezmmHnGQ</a></p><p>— Billions (@SHO_Billions) <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">February 28, 2023</a></p><h2>Damian Lewis will return to the character of Billions.</h2><p>The season 5 conclusion, dubbed No Way Home, saw Lewis’ Axelrod fleeing from law enforcement once more. In the end, he vanished in a cloak-and-dagger manner with a fortune and fled to Switzerland to avoid punishment in New York.&nbsp;The conclusion signaled Lewis’ exit from the show, but it also left the door open for him to return to the series at some point in the future. His departure in 2021 occurred shortly after the loss of his wife, actress Helen McCrory, that same year.</p><p>Speaking on his exit, the performer had said that his five-season tenure as Axe was:</p><p>“This is easily the most time I’ve spent playing a single character. It’s tough to keep digging, artistically… There’s a chance I’ll be able to return. But, for the time being, Axe has been defeated.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Damian-Lewis-1.jpg alt="Damian Lewis" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Season 6 premiered last winter and will end with the season conclusion on April 10, 2022. The sitcom is returning for a seventh season, with Lewis reprising his role as Axe. Billions is presently in production in New York, and Lewis’ comeback was revealed last November when he was observed filming with his co-stars outside the Tower of London.</p><p>Damian Lewis is an English actor best known for his role as US Army Major Richard Winters in the HBO drama Band of Brothers, for which he was nominated for a Golden Globe. On Showtime’s Homeland, he earned an Emmy for his portrayal of US Marine Corps Sgt. Nicholas Brody (2011 to 2013).</p><h2>All About&nbsp;Season 7 of Billions</h2><p>The formal summary for the drama’s seventh season is as follows:</p><p>“Alliances are flipped on their shoulders in Season 7. Past scars have been armed. Loyalty is put to the proof. Deception takes on colossal dimensions. Opponents turn into cautious allies. And Bobby Axelrod returns as the stakes rise from Wall Street to the international stage.”</p><p>Along with Damian Lewis, the series reintroduces familiar faces such as David Costabile, Asia Kate Dillon, Condola Rashad, Jeffrey DeMunn, Sakina Jaffrey, and Daniel Breaker. Toney Goins, who portrays Philip, has been elevated to normal season status in Season 7.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Damian-Lewis-2.jpg alt="Damian Lewis" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>The forthcoming season, from authors, executive producers, and showrunners Brian Koppelman, David Levien, Beth Schacter, and Andrew Ross Sorkin, is set to premiere on Showtime this autumn. Furthermore, the network has revealed the development of four new offshoot shows.
