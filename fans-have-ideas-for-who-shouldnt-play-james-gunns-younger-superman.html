He‚Äôs starred in many supporting roles in several television shows in his native Britain, and has lent his voice to a number of animated releases, but a role like Clark Kent seems way too far outside of his wheelhouse. Known for his comedic talents and charisma while holding interviews, Superman would require a lot from the actor that many have never seen before from him.
