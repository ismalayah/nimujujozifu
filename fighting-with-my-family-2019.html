Their home proves to be a charming atmosphere, where the parents, former-convict and current teddy bear Ricky (<a href=#>Nick Frost</a>) and force of nature Julia (<a href=#>Lena Headey</a>), love each other deeply. The family shares this positive atmosphere in their wrestling gym and indie wrestling league in their working-class English town, where they teach a band of excitable young kids how to pin, bounce off the ropes, etc. The two stars are the now-grown Knight children, Saraya (<a href=#>Florence Pugh</a>), her jet-black hair and lip ring as definitive as her shyness and shortness, and the slightly hot-headed Zac (<a href=#>Jack Lowden</a>). The Knight clan sees each other as equals, and when they do fight, it’s the good kind.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p>One of the film's funniest scenes is early on,&nbsp;when the Knights meet&nbsp;the parents of Kirsten (<a href=#>Aqueela Zoll</a>), Zac’s girlfriend. With Kirsten’s dad played by the comparably demure Merchant, the Knight family are true bulls in a china shop of delicate upper-class niceties. To watch Merchant interact with them is especially&nbsp;funny, while highlighting how this family has their own language, and that they can’t help but be themselves. Most of all, they’re proud of where they’ve come from. It makes for a very warming&nbsp;ensemble comedy, the quartet’s chemistry making a vivid nest that Saraya soon leaves when she gets a shot at professional wrestling.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p>Saraya's steady ascent to WWE stardom with blood, sweat, tears, and personal branding&nbsp;(where she changes her stage name from Britani to Paige) then presents Merchant with a narrative challenge he doesn’t entirely pin down—how do you show a character’s progress arc in an industry where everything is fixed, not faked? He finds a&nbsp;solution in part by not forgetting about Zac when he doesn’t make the cut, and putting a lot of dramatic screen-time into&nbsp;Paige’s weaknesses—that she isn’t as strong as some of the other women, which her coach Hutch (played with tough love by <a href=#>Vince Vaughn</a>) reminds her about. Worst of all, she&nbsp;gets stage fright when it comes to the essential act of talking trash in the ring. Pugh and Lowden’s full-bodied dramatic performances express the complete frustration and isolation within these shortcomings, representing hard-working people&nbsp;who are&nbsp;tempted&nbsp;to give up on a dream for many reasons. This eventually makes for moments in which the film, as unabashedly formulaic as it is, can be genuinely inspiring.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46foKCgpJ67qHnWoquhZZ2ueqetzKKjsmViZX56</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
