Whether <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Elvis</a> is as rollicking as Luhrmann’s previous directorial efforts remains to be seen, but it’s unlikely to be the kind of rote biopic that can often make the genre feel stale.</p><h3 id=h-aline data-injectable=false>Aline</h3><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=602 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=317 data-current-count=317 data-injectable=false>A pseudo-biopic that reimagines Celine Dion’s life through the lends of a fictional pop star, the film chronicles the singer’s life from her childhood through middle age, and stars French singer Victoria Sio, who famously plays her version of Celine Dion even when Celine is just 7 years old in the film.</p><h3 id=h-maestro data-injectable=false>Maestro</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/Bradley-Cooper-Deeper.jpg><p data-characters=406 data-current-count=406 data-injectable=true><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Bradley Cooper</a> is following up A Star is Born with Maestro, a biopic about composter Leonard Bernstein that he will co-write, direct, and star in. Carey Mulligan, Jeremy Strong, and Maya Hawke are set to co-star in the film, and Cooper has said that Bernstein was a childhood hero of his. Steven Spielberg was originally supposed to direct, but handed the reins over to Cooper after seeing A Star is Born.</p><h3 id=h-untitled-madonna-biopic data-injectable=false>Untitled Madonna biopic</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/GettyImages-72574510.jpg><p data-characters=403 data-current-count=703 data-injectable=true>Only <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Madonna</a> would dare to direct a biopic about her own life, and while the movie is still untitled, it’s already hotly anticipated. The <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">casting process</a> for the role of Madonna has reportedly been intense, and actresses like Julia Garner, Florence Pugh, Alexa Demie, and Emma Laird are all in contention for the role. Whoever it winds up being, the final product is guaranteed to be fascinating.</p><h3 id=h-weird-the-al-yankovic-story data-injectable=false>Weird: The Al Yankovic Story</h3><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=429 data-current-count=729 data-injectable=true>Daniel Radcliffe may not seem like the most natural pick to play Weird Al Yankovic, but the first looks we’ve seen suggest that it might just be crazy enough to work. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Weird: The Al Yankovic Story</a> comes from a script co-written by Weird Al, and seems to be poking fun at how little controversy surrounds the beloved parody songwriter. Other than Weird Al, we still know fairly little about what the full film will be about.</p><h3 id=h-untitled-martin-scorsese-grateful-dead-movie data-injectable=false>Untitled Martin Scorsese Grateful Dead movie</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/jonah-hill.jpg><p data-characters=408 data-current-count=708 data-injectable=true><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Martin Scorsese</a> always has several projects in the hopper, but it seems like his Grateful Dead movie with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Jonah Hill</a> as Jerry Garcia is really going to happen. Hill has already grown out his hair and beard for the role, and he’s also set to produce the film alongside Scorsese. The biopic will debut on Apple TV Plus, and Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski will write the screenplay for the project.</p><h3 id=h-untitled-dolly-parton-biopic data-injectable=false>Untitled Dolly Parton biopic</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/GettyImages-633047684.jpg><p data-characters=415 data-current-count=715 data-injectable=true>This project is still in its earliest stages, but<strong> </strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Dolly Parton</a> is reportedly in talks to turn her life story into a feature film. Parton has also said that Broadway veteran <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Kristin Chenoweth</a> is on the top of her list for the title role, and that the movie would likely take audiences through each stage of her life. She also said that Jim Carrey could make for a great Porter Wagoner, her one-time musical partner.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/maxresdefault.jpg><h3 id=h-piano-man data-injectable=false>Piano Man</h3><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=416 data-current-count=716 data-injectable=true>Perhaps the most confusing entry on this list, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Variety</a> has reported that a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Billy Joel</a> biopic titled Piano Man is in the works, but that no music or life rights have been given by Billy Joel. The film will reportedly focus on Joel’s early years, including his teenage band The Hassles and his performance for Clive Davis in 1972. At this point, though, the bio part of this biopic is still a big question mark.</p><h3 id=h-untitled-george-clinton-biopic data-injectable=false>Untitled George Clinton biopic</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/GettyImages-1162827659.jpg><p data-characters=396 data-current-count=696 data-injectable=true><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Eddie Murphy</a> is currently in early talks to play George Clinton, the man widely regarded as the godfather of soul. The film is part of a three-picture deal with Amazon Prime Video, and Murphy is still working on a acquiring the rights to Clinton’s life.

The project was originally supposed to be helmed by Kenneth Branagh, who had to drop out because of scheduling conflicts, and is set to be written by John Logan. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Barry Gibb</a> is reportedly “very involved” in the feature, but no cast has been announced yet.</p><h3 id=h-george-and-tammy data-injectable=false>George and Tammy</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/GettyImages-1388481426.jpg><p data-characters=335 data-current-count=635 data-injectable=true>An upcoming miniseries will tell the story of country singer Tammy Wynette and her husband George Jones.
