In 2002, Joseph’s mother-in-law, Annamma Thomas, died under unexplained circumstances, according to <a href=#>CNN</a>. Six years later, in 2008, Joseph’s father-in-law was also dead of a presumed heart attack. Given the age of the deceased and cultural customs in India, no post-mortem was performed on either body.</p><p data-characters=477 data-current-count=477 data-injectable=true>A short time later, Jolly’s husband — Roy Thomas — also passed. This time, however, there was a post-mortem, concluding Thomas died from cyanide poisoning but it was ruled out to be a suicide given the financial issues he was enduring at the time. By 2016, though, three more people connected to Jolly lost their lives, including her deceased husband’s uncle, the two-year-old daughter (named Alphine) of Roy’s cousin Shaju, and the child’s mother.</p><p data-characters=193 data-current-count=193 data-injectable=false>What could have motivated such a crime spree, or was it all just deadly bad luck? According to the facts unearthed in the investigation of the case, Jolly killed all of them for love and money.</p><h2 id=h-jolly-joseph-remarried data-injectable=false>Jolly Joseph remarried</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=493 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=447 data-current-count=447 data-injectable=true>About a year after the last two deaths, Jolly Joseph got remarried to Shaju Zacharias, Alphine’s father and Roy’s cousin, in 2017. The investigation discovered that Jolly had secretly changed the family will in 2011, transferring assets to her. According to the prosecution, Jolly killed the other members of her family either to cover her tracks or to get closer to Zacharias, with whom she had an affair and wanted to one day marry.</p><p data-characters=315 data-current-count=315 data-injectable=false>Meanwhile, other stories Jolly told about her life began to fall apart, like her claim to work as a professor at the National Institute of Technology Calicut (NIT) university. Kozhikode district police superintendent KG Simon told <a href=#>CNN</a>: “One of the first things that got us to suspect her was her behavior.”</p><p data-characters=291 data-current-count=606 data-injectable=false>At first, Jolly maintained she was innocent, but before long, she confessed to her murder spree, and in 2019, she was arrested at age 47. As of 2023, Joseph remains in custody in India and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">is still awaiting trial</a>. If convicted, Jolly could be sentenced to life in prison or be put to death.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekp8KmecKroKadX6y1sHnIrGSjp5yhxm62zqycqaBdnrtuusStnaWhqKh6pMHRq7BmmZ6ZeqTFwKegnZ1dlruledahnKudXZ7Abr%2FHnmSnp6dk</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
