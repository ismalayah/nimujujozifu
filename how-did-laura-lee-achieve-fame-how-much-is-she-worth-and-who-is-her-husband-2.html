From posting videos of her makeup routines on Instagram, Lee has transformed into a beauty influencer and a YouTube sensation. Today, her YouTube Channel has over 630 million views and 4.5 million subscribers. Asides having millions of followers across all social media platforms, Lee also runs a thriving makeup brand. However, her successful empire recently took a hit due to controversial tweets she made in the past. Get to know more about Lee here, including her ethnicity, net worth, husband, and family.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=a-lense-zoom-on-laura-lees-early-life></span><strong>A Lense Zoom on Laura Lee’s Early Life<br></strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Laura Ann Lee was born on the 1st of September 1988 in Montgomery, Alabama, United States. She is American by nationality and Caucasian by ethnicity. Before becoming a beauty aficionado and an influential beauty blogger, Laura Lee worked various jobs. She was a preschool teacher and medical assistant to a dermatologist.</p><p>Not so much is known about Lee’s early life, education, parents or what they did for a living. What’s no secret however is that she comes from a family of five, consisting of her parents, an elder brother and a sister named Ashley Lee. Lee describes her mom as a hardworking, independent woman who stood as an inspiration to all three of her children.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-shot-her-to-fame></span><strong>What Shot Her to Fame?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Lee’s journey into the beauty industry began while working as a medical assistant to an Alabama-based dermatologist. Though she had always been a makeup enthusiast, her work environment demanded that she tone down her makeup. Since she couldn’t wear much makeup to the office, she resorted to putting on her makeup at home and sharing the video on Instagram. What began as tips and tricks in 2012 soon goT so much reception among her then-fledgling Instagram audience.</p><p>It helped that Laura Lee’s make-up tricks hit home for thousands of young women her age. This led to more influx of viewers especially since her routines showed viewers how to look gorgeous while spending less. She got so much love and positive reaction and soon, her passion turned into a full-time endeavor.</p><p>That led to the start of her first YouTube channel in March 2013.&nbsp;The channel features makeup tutorials, product reviews, life hacks, etc. Over the years, it has garnered 4.5 million subscribers and over 630 million+ views. Surely, all those numbers would translate to something monetary at the end of the day. Let’s show you how it all adds up.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=laura-lees-net-worth-today></span><strong>Laura Lee’s Net Worth Today<br></strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>If you knew Laura Lee from her early days, you would also know that her delivery online is much different from what it used to be; in many respects. That has translated to lots of dollars for the young YouTuber. Lee has transformed what used to be a mere hobby into a thriving business. Today, she has her makeup brand; Laura Lee Los Angeles. The brand offers products such as eye shadow palettes, lipsticks, highlighters, and eyeliners. The Alabama native has also collaborated with other beauty brands such as MAC Cosmetics and Benefit Cosmetics. She also runs two eponymous YouTube channels; one being her main channel and the other, her vlogging channel.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-does-she-earn-from-youtube></span><strong>How Does She Earn From YouTube?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Lee’s net worth is currently estimated at a cool $1.5 million. She makes the bulk of her money from her popular YouTube channels and reportedly earns between $5,000 and $60,000 monthly from the platform. Here’s the ABC of that.</p><p>With over 4.5 million subscribers and about 700 million views so far, her new videos (published multiple times a week) garner an average of 330,000 views daily. If the math is right, that should generate around $1,650 per day ($600,000 annually) from ads get featured on her videos.</p><p>Her vlog YouTube channel has over a quarter of a million subscribers and has garnered over 3 million views. It rakes around 10,000 views daily, generating around $50 per day.</p><p>In the United States, YouTubers are paid between $2 to $7 per 1000 monetized views after YouTube deducts its share. Monetized YouTube views fall within 40% – 80% of the total views. However, this is not a cast-iron rule. They are influenced by factors such as viewers’ location, viewing device (PC or mobile), ad engagement, ad inventory, how many viewers skip ads, the number of ads on a video, the kind of advertisement, content type and so on. Ad view costs are often determined by an auction between YouTube advertisers based on the number of views. In this case, brands that advertise on YouTube would have to bid a minimum of $0.01/view.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=her-other-channels-of-income></span><strong>Her Other Channels of Income</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Asides her YouTube earnings, Laura Lee has also embarked upon several profitable ventures and partnerships with MAC Cosmetics as well as Benefit Cosmetics. All of which ensure a steady inflow of income to maintain a comfortable lifestyle for the businesswoman.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=laura-lees-racism-scandal></span><strong>Laura Lee’s Racism Scandal</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The beauty guru’s career came under fire in 2018 when a string of racism scandals engulfed the YouTube beauty industry. It all started when popular YouTuber, Jeffree Star, was embroiled in allegations of racism and sexism. This meant a huge loss of fans and followers.</p><p>Following his public apology, another member of the YouTube click, Gabriel Zamora, posted a picture of himself and other YouTubers (including Laura Lee), mocking Star and saying that they would never be fans of a racist. This angered many of Star’s fans who retaliated by digging up old offensive tweets by Zamora, Lee, and co. And bad for Laura, they found one. It was a 2012 tweet in which she said: Tip for all black people if you pull ur pants up you can run from the police faster. #yourwelcome.</p><p>In the wake of the scandal, several beauty companies ended their partnerships with Lee. She has since released two apology videos in a bid to make amends. All the while, she hasn’t lost her cool. Thanks to her supportive partner and friend. Let’s show you more about him.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=who-is-the-man-in-her-life></span><strong>Who is the Man in Her Life?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Laura Lee has been married to her long-time boyfriend, Tyler Williams, since May 19, 2015. The two met in high school and started dating in 2008. They got engaged in 2012 and tied the knot in 2015. Tyler is also a native of Alabama and a graduate of industrial engineering. He works for Amazon and when his company offered him a transfer to another region, the couple picked California so that Lee would have a chance to grow her budding social media empire.</p><p>Seeing that she has become a YouTube celebrity, it is one decision that certainly paid off. The camera-shy Tyler is quite supportive of his wife’s enterprise and often appears in her videos. One of her most popular videos is titled DIY Blackhead Mask on My Husband. The 2017 video has accumulated over 8 million views.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaKCfrHqltcNmo5qtopZ6rbHEZpicoJmaw6Z5xZqknmWYpMRuudScn2aho2LAqbGMsKarrJhirq%2BwjLCfqGWZqHqpsdFmn66rkpa7pXmRaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
