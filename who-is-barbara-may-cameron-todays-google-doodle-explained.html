A creative from the Dakotas’ Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, Cameron was a Hunkpapa&nbsp;Lakota who played a major part in increasing visibility for Native American gays. Her work broke barriers, and ultimately led to the formation of several organizations that remain in operation today.</p><p data-characters=544 data-current-count=544 data-injectable=true>Without Cameron, the Gay American Indians organization would not exist, and the state of several organizations and celebrations would likely be set massively back. She made her mark on the&nbsp;Lesbian Gay Freedom Day Parade and Celebration — which, in modern days, is largely referred to as San Francisco Pride — as well as the&nbsp;Alice B. Toklas LGBT Democratic Club, after helping to organize the former for a full five years in the early ’80s, and serving as vice president for the latter in the second half of the same decade.</p><p data-characters=469 data-current-count=469 data-injectable=false>Cameron didn’t spend all of her time fighting for human rights, either. In between organizing impactful events or heading organizations, she also published several essays — in collections like This Bridge Called My Back: Writings by Radical Women of Color, A Gathering of Spirit: A Collection of Writing and Art by North American Indian Women, and New Our Right to Love: A Lesbian Resource Book — and continues to be celebrated for her photography and poetry.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2TEqbuMoqpmmpGnr6K%2BwGakmrFdmK6usdGopWasn5muur%2BMoKaon5yaeqW7zp2jnmWVrb2trcinnJ1n</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
