Since then, it has come back in a variety of forms, the most longstanding of which is its current one, which began in 1984.</p><p data-characters=452 data-current-count=743 data-injectable=true>The Jeopardy! format is <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">classic and immortal</a>. It’s arguably the most popular game show to ever grace the small screen, and its continued relevance a full 40 seasons in proves that nothing will ever <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">quite beat its appeal</a>. Avid fans go so far as to plan their days around the nightly episodes, but not everyone has the flexibility to settle in so frequently. So, for those unable to watch the show as it airs live, is there a streaming alternative?</p><h2 id=h-can-you-stream-jeopardy data-injectable=false>Can you stream Jeopardy?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=101 data-current-count=401 data-injectable=true>The simple answer to the above question is yes, you can stream episodes of Jeopardy! after they air.</p><p data-characters=408 data-current-count=408 data-injectable=true>But there’s a big catch. Old, random episodes of the program <strong>can </strong>be enjoyed over on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Pluto TV </a>— for free, no less — but they won’t be recent, or in order. Instead, the show airs its old episodes in a chaotic mix — an episode from season 3 here, followed by one from season 14, and then another from season 32 — but, given the show’s format, that’s not necessarily a bad thing.</p><p data-characters=308 data-current-count=308 data-injectable=false>Sure, it would mess us all up to get random, non-concurrent episodes of a show like Euphoria, but a quiz show like Jeopardy! doesn’t have a story to follow or a plot to maintain. It features new contestants almost every episode — <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">with rare exceptions</a> — and each episode is largely self-sustaining.</p><p data-characters=189 data-current-count=497 data-injectable=true>For those who are entirely caught up on Jeopardy! and would like access to its most recent episodes, however, this scattered streaming release schedule is going to be a little frustrating.</p><p data-characters=560 data-current-count=560 data-injectable=false>It doesn’t appear that Jeopardy! provides access to its currently airing episodes in any kind of trackable release schedule, which leaves fans with few options outside of Pluto TV’s consistent stream of old episodes. Still, access to Jeopardy! is access to Jeopardy!, and providing a completely free (albeit ad-supported) avenue to enjoy the show outside of cable restrictions is pretty great. Just don’t get your hopes up regarding season 40 — that likely won’t be showing up on streaming until season 41 is airing, at the earliest.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3yqv4ytn56qlWKubrzLmpqeZaSkerTA0Z6YpmWamryxrdGdsGaZlqmys3nLoq2eZZWltrS7w56qZpmZp3w%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
