Unfortunately, while some are already loving Will Poulter’s take on the super-powerful cosmic hero, others feel like James Gunn has dropped the ball after years of hype for his arrival and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">he doesn’t look as epic as he should</a>, whether that be his golden spray tan or his overly complicated costume.</p><h2 id=h-the-marvels-leak-leaves-fans-missing-an-apparently-vital-part-of-ms-marvel-s-character data-injectable=false>The Marvels leak leaves fans missing an apparently vital part of Ms. Marvel’s character</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Kamala-Peace-Signs-ms.-marvel_.jpg><p data-characters=612 data-current-count=912 data-injectable=true>We’ve already had one merch leak for The Marvels that gave us a glimpse of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Carol Danvers’ revamped look</a> for next year’s sequel, and now another one has followed that does the same for Kamala Khan. Unfortunately, in what seems to be a recurring theme today, Ms. Marvel’s costume update has been less well-received. You see, it appears that the Jersey City native will be missing a key piece of her outfit in her movie debut that <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">folks think messes up her whole ensemble</a>. She may have escaped the Department of Damage Control, but Kamala’s not wily enough to avoid the Fashion Police.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Everyone’s already betting on who’ll get got in Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol-3-Rocket-Raccoon-1.jpg><p data-characters=508 data-current-count=808 data-injectable=true>While there are those arguing over Adam Warlock, the vast majority of Guardians fans were of course blown away by the trailer, with the brief teases at some big dramatic moments to come leaving them <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">prematurely in tears</a>. Those with a slightly stonier disposition, though, are already breaking down <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">who’s most likely to meet their end</a> in the threequel, with the smart money being on Drax — given Dave Bautista’s outspoken interest in being done with Marvel — and Rocket. Say it ain’t so!</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Quantumania director confirms Kang will leave Thanos in the dust</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/ant-man-and-the-wasp-quantumania-kang.jpg><p data-characters=529 data-current-count=829 data-injectable=true>Meanwhile, the Ant-Man 3 trailer <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">gave us an even juicier tease</a> at Scott Lang’s confrontation with Jonathan Majors’ Kang the Conqueror, which has left us even more worrisome over whether Paul Rudd’s hero is actually going to survive this one in tact. Sure enough, director <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Peyton Reed has promised</a> that the Multiverse Saga supervillain is beyond than anything we’ve seen in the MCU to date, and that includes the Mad Titan himself, Thanos.
