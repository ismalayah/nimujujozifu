Adams made his own trite and unfunny contribution to the conversation last May when he finally introduced a black character into his then 32-year-old comic strip.</p><p data-characters=477 data-current-count=477 data-injectable=true>The “punchline” was that Dave, Dilbert’s team’s first black engineer “identified as white.” A real knee-slapper that not only purposefully misconstrues the construct of race but also manages to be transphobic as well. It’s almost a surprise that Dave wasn’t an “attack helicopter” but why waste the opportunity to make one sweeping and incorrect generalization when you can misrepresent two birds with the same stone?</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>I've lost three careers to direct racism so far. Crocker Bank, Pacific Bell, and cartooning.</p><p>All three were perpetrated by White people for their own gain.</p><p>No Black person has ever discriminated against me. That's partly why I identified as Black for several years.</p>— Scott Adams (@ScottAdamsSays) <a href=#>February 27, 2023</a></figure><p data-characters=339 data-current-count=639 data-injectable=true>And the strip is aging like milk a little less than a year later now that the cartoonist has thrown all restraint to the wind and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">called black people a hate group and told white people to avoid them whenever possible. </a>One begins to suspect that “Dave wasn’t exactly brought into the strip to increase its representation.”</p><p data-characters=537 data-current-count=537 data-injectable=true>Adams insists that his message has been misconstrued and that he himself is the victim here. Specifically for the actual cancellation of his strip as well as, interestingly enough, every other career Adams has “lost.” A recent <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Tweet</a> by Adams assigns the blame to the racism of white people (Adams can’t quite seem to get his “hate groups” sorted out) who struck out against him for their own “gain.” Adams characteristically does not explain how a company gains by firing a competent employee.</p><p data-characters=260 data-current-count=260 data-injectable=false>But Adams really doubles down when he calls back his own lame “joke” that he himself identifies as black — a statement that even were it sincere, would only indicate that Adams was one of the most tone-deaf individuals on the face of the planet.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=560 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr>The media assigns your opinion.
