At the beginning of the Syrup Village Arc, Klahadore appears as an innocent ‚Äî if overbearing ‚Äî butler to the chronically ill Kaya but he soon reveals his true colors by killing Merry and attempting to murder Kaya for the rights to her shipyard.</p><p data-characters=468 data-current-count=468 data-injectable=true>Klahadore confirms his true identity as Kuro when Zoro realizes he recognizes the butler‚Äôs face from seeing his wanted poster. Kuro ‚Äî while not a devil fruit user ‚Äî is extremely fast and has special gloves outfitted with sharp ‚Äúcat claws‚Äù he uses to kill his prey. He‚Äôs a dangerous antagonist in both the anime and manga, and the live-action was able to do the character justice thanks in no small part to his actor ‚Äì <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Alexander Maniatis</a></strong>.</p><h2 id=h-who-is-alexander-maniatis data-injectable=false>Who is Alexander Maniatis?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>Absolutely overwhelmed and moved by all the amazing and moving messages regarding One Piece and Kuro!
