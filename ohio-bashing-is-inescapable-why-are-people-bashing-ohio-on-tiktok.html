Many people are discovering that their TikTok is suddenly covered with memes focused on and mocking the 7th most-populated American state."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

And it almost seems like the entire internet is just this one meme.&nbsp;</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=274 data-current-count=274 data-injectable=false>This is very true about memes focused on the state of Ohio. Many people are discovering that their TikTok is suddenly covered with memes focused on and mocking the 7th most-populated American state. But what is “Ohio-Bashing,” and why did it become a meme?&nbsp;</p><h3 id=h-the-origins-of-ohio-bashing data-injectable=false>The origins of Ohio-Bashing</h3><p data-characters=235 data-current-count=509 data-injectable=true>Interestingly, memes about Ohio are far from new. Anti-Ohio memes have their origins way back in 2016 when a Tumblr user named screenshotofdespair posted a picture of a bus station sign that read: “Ohio will be eliminated.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-tumblr wp-block-embed-tumblr" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a href=#>https://screenshotsofdespair.tumblr.com/post/148522431714</a></figure><p data-characters=428 data-current-count=728 data-injectable=true>This picture quickly went viral on the site, and people started building on the concept. The image got reposted on many other websites, further increasing its virality. In 2017, Reddit user chukotkaa edited a joke map titled “How far away is Ohio,” transforming it into “Danger Presented by Ohio.” And, like the previous image, this also went viral, with many users making their own version of this meme.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit wp-block-embed-reddit" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a href=#>Danger presented by Ohio but now they got a whole world domination plan</a> from <a href=#>mapporncirclejerk</a></figure><p data-characters=506 data-current-count=806 data-injectable=true>And after this, the Ohio memes continued. In 2018 an image of Garfield with the text “Time to nuke Ohio” became popular, being reposted on several subreddits and other image platforms.&nbsp;However, this whole thing reached its zenith in 2019, when someone posted an MS Paint version of the widespread “Its all America” meme with it changed so that the entire world is Ohio. (Incidentally, this meme would evolve into the more-viral “Two Astronauts” meme we know today.)</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>all of it <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/RPPPKhXUv1</a></p>— 🥽 – ONLYDON (🦴) (@burgertownmw2) <a href=#>December 10, 2019</a></figure><p data-characters=374 data-current-count=674 data-injectable=true>Soon after, two popular meme accounts were made. On Facebook, there was “Posting that one Ohio meme every single day,” and OhioHateMemes was set up on iFunny. Further spreading the concept of memes focused on hating Ohio. And this trend continued to grow, with many memes posting images of Ohio invading other states or taking over the entirety of America.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit wp-block-embed-reddit" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a href=#>Oh god oh fuc Ohio is expanding</a> from <a href=#>memes</a></figure><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit wp-block-embed-reddit" data-current-count=600 data-injectable=true><a href=#>OH NO</a> from <a href=#>ItsTimeToNukeOhio</a></figure><p data-characters=389 data-current-count=389 data-injectable=false>This meme soon spread to TikTok, with people posting weird or odd videos with the caption “Only in Ohio,” or “Normal day in Ohio” implying the state is full of peculiar and confusing things, almost as if it’s the Twilight Zone of the USA. And these memes have also spread to other platforms, with many giving classic meme templates an Ohio-themed twist.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok" data-current-count=689 data-injectable=true><a title=@_s3m1h_ href=#>@_s3m1h_</a><p>Normal day in Ohio 💀💀💀<a title=fy href=#>#fy</a></p><a title="♬ Swag Like Ohio - Lil B" href=#>♬ Swag Like Ohio – Lil B</a></figure><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a title=@slimreeper55 href=#>@slimreeper55</a><p>Ohio🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️</p><a title="♬ original sound - SlimReeper55" href=#>♬ original sound – SlimReeper55</a></figure><p data-characters=339 data-current-count=639 data-injectable=true>In June of 2022, this meme transformed again when the term “Ohio Syndrome” was coined. A play on the Japanese and Chinese concept of “Paris syndrome” (where people develop a deep sadness when they discover Paris isn’t as good as the romanticized version they’ve imagined), Ohio Syndrome is described as:</p><p>“The overwhelming sense of despair experienced by most individuals when visiting Ohio, who feel that the state is just as bad as they expected.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=459 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr>It's THE Ohio Syndrome, get it right <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/P7PQz92J5g</a></p>— Dr. Kevin Griffith, PhD (@AssumeNormality) <a href=#>June 22, 2022</a></figure><p data-characters=283 data-current-count=283 data-injectable=false>So it seems that Ohio is one of those concepts that has just captured the internet’s imagination. Spawning loads of different meme trends just because the concept amuses the internet hivemind and its inherent surrealness allows it to be applied to many different meme formats.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmejpLCqrctmpJ6cmZZ8sLTIqGSbmaOdtq%2BzjKKqZqGemsCkrc%2BamaWdXay1unnAq5xmqJWkva2xjJuYrKCZo7Ruu8eipmannmLBqrfTqKJo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
