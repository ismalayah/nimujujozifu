They co-wrote Journey 2: The Mysterious Island and Brightburn, both of which have taken on interesting context given James Gunn’s involvement with DC. Journey 2 stars Dwayne Johnson, who would go on to headline the DC flop Black Adam, and Brightburn was sold as a nightmarish riff on the Superman origin story, which will be adapted by James for the upcoming reboot Superman: Legacy.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2TEqbuMmqmeZZqWuqa%2FjKCsp6ajYsCqrsuipaCrXw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
