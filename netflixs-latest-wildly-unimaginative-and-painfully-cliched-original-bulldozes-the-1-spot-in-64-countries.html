The CGI is unconvincing, the jokes are cringeworthy, the set pieces are perfunctory, and it’s about as derivative and uninspired as its central concept could possibly hope to be; but dammit, it’s Arnold, so it gets a pass.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/FUBAR-3.jpg><p data-characters=456 data-current-count=756 data-injectable=true>That’s a feeling clearly being shared by subscribers all over the world, seeing as FUBAR has shrugged off lukewarm reviews and an underwhelming response from audiences to debut as the platform’s number one episodic effort on a global scale.
