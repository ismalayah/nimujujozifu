Tobias is known as the Legendary trainer so there are chances he also poses more of legendaries.Fun fact: Ash could have won the Sinnoh if Tobias wasn't there cause even in the finals, he required only his Darkrai to win.
The 3rd Pokemon in Tobias' team might be Entei. Entei was seen in the theme song of Sinnoh league Victors, the last season of the Sinnoh region."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Entei was seen in the theme song of Sinnoh league Victors, the last season of the Sinnoh region. Moreover, Infernape was battling it. So it may mean that the writers thought that Ash is gonna defeat Tobias' Latios and then fight Entei with his Infernape. But they changed their mind. So I believe Tobias has an Entei in his possession as one Entei is born in a Volcanic eruption so it means there are a lot of Entei's in the Pokemon World!</p><p>Next up Heatran, there are high chances that Tobias has a Heatran because it is a legendary Pokemon introduced in the Sinnoh region and he is more likely to have Pokémons from his own region unless he travelled to different regions.</p><p>The next pokemon is not a legendary but it is no less stronger! It's none other than Lucario. Lucario like Entei, was spotted in the theme song of Diamond and Pearl battling Palkia. Many believe, Tobias fought Dialga and Palkia and he used his Lucario. And we also know Lucario was also introduced in Gen 4. So I won't be surprised if Tobias' last Pokemon is Lucario!</p><p>Now for the last place, sadly we have no leads but there is a chance he may possess a legendary from gen 1 - gen 3 or even have the Eon duo. He already has Latios so he might even have Latias.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiapaGvorPAq5uepl6jsrV706GpnpmUqHy1u8GimKxloKS4prnOp2StnZGie3OEknJrb2c%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
