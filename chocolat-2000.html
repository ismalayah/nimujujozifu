Like Catherine Deneuve's, her beauty is not only that of youth, but will carry her through life, and here she looks so ripe and wholesome that her very presence is an argument against the local prudes. Whether her character has deeper agendas, whether she is indeed a witch, as some believe, or a pagan priestess, as she seems to hint, is left unresolved by the movie--but anyone who schedules a fertility celebration up against Easter Sunday is clearly picking a fight.</p><p>The town is ruled by Comte de Reynaud (<a href=#>Alfred Molina</a>), whose wealth and books do not console him for the absence of his wife, who is allegedly visiting Venice, but may just have packed up and moved out. Reynaud styles himself as the local arbiter of morals, even writing the sermons which Father Henri (<a href=#>Hugh O'Conor</a>) delivers from the pulpit while the complacent aristocrat's lips move contentedly in unison.</p><p>There are troubles in the town, quickly confided to Vianne, who consoles Josephine (<a href=#>Lena Olin</a>) after she is beaten by her husband Serge (<a href=#>Peter Stormare</a>). It is a convention in such stories that husbands tend toward wife-beating, and a quiet argument is made for the superior state of Vianne, who is the unmarried mother of Anouk (<a href=#>Victoire Thivisol</a>), and thus harbors no potential brute beneath her roof. She does, however, have an interest in the opposite sex, represented by Roux (<a href=#>Johnny Depp</a>), who anchors his houseboat in the nearby river and shocks the bourgeoisie with his communal lifestyle.</p><p>Vianne's chocolates contain magic ingredients like the foods in "Like Water for Chocolate," and soon her shop is a local healing center. One confection seems to work like Viagra, while others inspire love, not lust, and inspire an old man (<a href=#>John Wood</a>) to screw up his courage and confess to a local widow (<a href=#>Leslie Caron</a>) that he has adored her forever. Even Armande (<a href=#>Judi Dench</a>), Vianne's opinionated old landlady, melts under the influence and ends her long hostility to her daughter (<a href=#>Carrie-Anne Moss</a>).</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46cn6ibn6GutXmRaWdp</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
