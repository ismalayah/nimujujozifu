He had gay friends and there’s just absolutely nothing to be ashamed of there.”</p><p>“But I had to speak the truth, which was I saw a very straight male who watched women, was married to women, had me,”&nbsp; the “Beverly Hills, 90210” actress continued. “Did he have affairs earlier in life? Perhaps. I don’t know. I wasn’t there to see it. So, I think it might not be a common misconception, but it’s certainly a rumor out there.”</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Jennifer’s mom, actress and filmmaker Dyan Cannon, 86, was Cary’s fourth wife. <span class=credit>Bettmann Archive</span></figure><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">One of the world’s most famous leading men, Cary starred in “His Girl Friday” and&nbsp;“The Philadelphia Story” and charmed audiences with debonaire looks. <span class=credit>Herbert Dorfman/Corbis via Getty Images</span></figure><p>One of the world’s most famous leading men, Cary starred in “His Girl Friday” and&nbsp;“The Philadelphia Story” and charmed audiences with debonaire looks.</p><p>He was married five times before dying in 1986 at the age of 82.</p><p>Jennifer’s mom, actress and filmmaker <a href=#>Dyan Cannon</a>, 86, was Cary’s fourth wife.</p><p><a href=#>“Archie,”</a> a new, four-part biographical series streaming on&nbsp;BritBox, is based on&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" data-nyp-affiliate=true>Dyan’s memoir</a> about her relationship with Cary, who was born Archibald Alexander Leach.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">He was married five times before dying in 1986 at the age of 82. <span class=credit>Archive Photos/Getty Images</span></figure><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Jennifer Grant said, “Had he been homosexual, I absolutely would’ve stood up for it.
